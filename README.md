# Summaryze Long Article

This Jupyter Notebook provides a basic use case for summarizing a long text file. It uses natural language processing techniques to condense the contents of the text file into a more manageable summary, making it easier to understand and analyze large amounts of information.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries for long text files.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilize NLP models to process and summarize text data.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: Easy-to-use interface for running and modifying the summarization process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Set up a Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project by copying the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific environment variables.

### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 6. Open the notebook

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `summaryze_long_article.ipynb` file.

### 7. Run the notebook

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to generate summaries of your text files.

## Usage

This notebook is designed for users who need to condense long pieces of text into shorter summaries. By running the cells in the notebook, you can input a text file and receive a summarized version of its contents.
